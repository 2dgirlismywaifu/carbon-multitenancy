Latest Released Version v4.5.0, v4.4.3.

#### carbon-multitenancy repo contains the the following component.

* tenant-mgt

The goal of multitenancy is to maximize resource sharing by allowing multiple users (tenants) to log in and use a single sever/cluster at the same time, in a tenant-isolated manner. That is, each user is given the experience of using his/her own server, rather than a shared environment. Multitenancy ensures optimal performance of the system's resources such as memory and hardware and also secures each tenant's personal data.

This repository contains the features required for multitenancy functionality.
